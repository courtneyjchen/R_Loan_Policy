## Project Summary

In the Loan Policy Proposal project, a team and I developed a solution for a financial services company to maximize their profit on loan repayments and reduce their financial risk using logistic regression and profit analysis. We first selected relevant features and created a logistic regression model, which used borrowers' financial history to predict loan repayments. We then conducted a profit analysis to find the optimal threshold value that maximizes the expected profit per customer. From this, we created a recommendation for the client that improves their current expected profit. 

The baseline strategy assumed that loans would be issued to all applicants, regardless of their risk level. In contrast, our upgraded strategy used a “Loan or No Loan” framework—only approving applicants whom the model predicted as low-risk. This approach significantly improved profitability, with our final strategy yielding a tenfold increase in expected profit per customer. These results demonstrate how predictive modeling and profit analysis can meaningfully guide strategic decisions and reduce exposure to default risk.
