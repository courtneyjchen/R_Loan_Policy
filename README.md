**Project Summary**

In the Loan Policy Proposal project, a team and I developed a solution for a financial services company to maximize their profit on loan repayments and reduce their financial risk using logistic regression and profit analysis. We first selected statistically significant features and created a logistic regression model, which used borrowers' financial history to predict loan repayments. We then conducted a profit analysis to find the optimal threshold value that maximizes the expected profit per customer. From this, we created a recommendation for the client that improves their current expected profit.
